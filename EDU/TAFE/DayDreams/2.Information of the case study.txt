2.Information of the case study.

-Current configuration:
•	Gigabit ethernet network cards on all computers and the servers.
•	Cat 6 cables connecting the computers and server via L2 switch.
•	Cisco Switches: Catalyst 2940.
•	One server providing file services, DNS, DHCP and email. OS: Windows Server 2016.
•	The server storage capacity does not adequately support the existing staff.
•	VPN is in place to support remote access functionality.
•	BackupExec hardware and software is used to maintain a 3/2/1 backup plan.
•	Many staff members complain that the network is too slow.

-Business concerns:
Daydreams systems need to become more secure with more redundancy, security elements, system monitoring and maintenance schedules. It would be good to keep a log of all staff system access and usage, plus access to data should be on need-to-know basis according to business role. Data should be accessible to staff as and when they need it from their location. 

-Strategic plan:
•	Increase number of on-site employees from 8 to 20.
•	Hire 10 work-from-home sales representatives that need 24/7 access to company’s resources and limited physical existence in the company’s premises (around 4 hours a week pp).
•	Implement new and innovative approaches to selecting travel destinations/recreation and bookings.
•	Make creative use of emerging technologies to meet the needs of our staff and therefore our clients.
•	Extend markets to surrounding suburbs and interstate.
•	A budget for the new technologies is set at $135,000.

-Organisational policies and procedures
•	Data privacy of staff and clients is to be maintained at all times.
•	Copyright and Intellectual Property rights are to be respected at all times, for our own property and others.
•	Transactions made in/by our business will have the clients’ best interest at heart.
•	Negligence will not be tolerated, particularly around loss of information and breach of legislation. Staff must be aware and follow process.
•	Honesty and respect are expected in all business dealings.

-Your role
As a Senior System Administrator, and a member of the IT team, management has requested you to design and configure a virtual network for the company and fully document the process. Your plan should provide a reasonable approach to the next stage of the transition away from on-site operations and towards virtual/cloud-based operations.
