Create a logical topology for virtual network below: 
 Use the table below as a framework. Use the third column to indicate the procedure or command you might use to achieve the implementation. Your completed table must address how you would use SSH and VPN to support the network.
 
Tools/Resources Gateways/Services	Applied to â€¦	How will you implement
Amazon S3	Will provide storage for all DTA operations in the local geographical area	Via the AWS management console or AWS CLI, create a new S3 bucket in the selected region - us-east-1
Amazon EC2	To host applications and provide scalable compute capacity	Deploy EC2 instances using the AWS management console, configure as per application requirements
AWS VPC	To create an isolated network for DTA's resources	Create a new VPC in AWS, configure subnets, route tables, and AWS IGW.
AWS IAM	Manage user access and permissions	Create IAM roles/policies for specific users or services to control access to AWS resources
Amazon RDS	Database service for managing relational databases	Setup RDS instances for application database requirements, ensuring proper security group settings
AWS VPN	To securely access DTA's network resources	Set up a Site-to-Site VPN connection between the on-premises network and AWS VPC
AWS Direct Connect	To establish a dedicated network connection from on-premises to AWS	Setup Direct Connect for consistent network performance
AWS Route 53	To manage DNS and direct end-user requests to the application	Configure Route 53 to route users to application hosted on EC2 instances
Amazon CloudFront	To deliver content securely and with low latency	Set up CloudFront distribution for application to speed up distribution of files and secure applications
AWS CloudTrail	For governance, compliance, and auditing of AWS environment	Enable CloudTrail to log and retain account activity related to actions across AWS infrastructure
AWS CloudWatch	For monitoring resources and applications on AWS	Set up CloudWatch alarms and metrics to monitor EC2 instances and RDS databases
Amazon EBS	Provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances	Attach EBS volumes to EC2 instances for application data storage
AWS Lambda	To run code without provisioning or managing servers	Use Lambda to automate tasks such as image processing or log file analysis
Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration	Speed up transfer of files over long distances	Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for the S3 bucket to speed up uploads to the bucket
